# Project Name

## Description
This repository provides a simple tool to simulate massive objects in space. Objects have zero volume, and are represented as point masses.

The user can set the starting conditions of the objects (initial position and velocity), their masses, and whether to hold them static in space.

Any number of domains can be run in a single simulation.
